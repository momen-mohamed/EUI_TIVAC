## Project Overview

The Calculator Project is designed to run on the TM4C123GH6PM TivaC microcontroller. It provides a feature-rich calculator with the ability to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. This calculator also supports prioritized operations and can handle negative numbers. It includes an ANS feature that allows the user to continue calculations after obtaining a result and handles division by zero and missing operands gracefully.

## Hardware Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- TM4C123GH6PM TivaC microcontroller board or equivalent.
- A suitable power supply for the microcontroller.
- A keypad or input method for user interaction (e.g., push buttons).
- An LCD display for output.

## Software Requirements

- Development environment for TM4C123GH6PM (e.g., TivaWare, Code Composer Studio).
- C/C++ Compiler.
- Appropriate communication interface (e.g., UART, USB) for loading the project onto the microcontroller.

## Project Features

- Four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Priority handling of operations (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
- Support for negative numbers.
- ANS (Answer) feature to continue calculations with the last result.
- Graceful handling of division by zero and missing operands.
- User-friendly LCD interface for input and output.

## Usage

1. Connect the TM4C123GH6PM TivaC microcontroller to the hardware components (keypad and LCD display).

2. Compile and load the Calculator Project onto the microcontroller.

3. Power on the microcontroller.

4. The LCD display will show the project title and author information.

5. Use the keypad or input method to perform calculations. Press 'C' to clear the calculator, '=' to display the result, and other keys for numeric input and operations.

6. The calculator will handle operations with priority (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).

7. The ANS feature allows you to continue calculations with the last result.

8. The calculator gracefully handles division by zero and missing operands, displaying appropriate messages.

9. Enjoy using your feature-rich calculator!
